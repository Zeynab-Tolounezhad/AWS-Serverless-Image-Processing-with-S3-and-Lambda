# AWS Serverless Image Processing with S3 and Lambda

# Solution Overview
This solution provides a serverless image processing application where users upload their images to an Amazon S3 bucket. The S3 event automatically triggers an AWS Lambda function to process and resize the uploaded image, and then store the final version in another S3 bucket.
